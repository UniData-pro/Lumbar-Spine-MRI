# Lumbar Spine MRI Scans - 2,4 million studies

The dataset contains **MRI images** of the lumbar vertebras and lumbar discs, focusing on the vertebras and lumbar intervertebral discs. The scans are accompanied with **medical reports** to help in diagnosing spine diseases such as *degenerative spine conditions, lumbar degenerative disorders, and disc herniations*. This dataset emphasizes spine magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar region and spinal canal and capture detailed spine imaging using sagittal T2-weighted images - **[Get the data](https://unidata.pro/datasets/spine-mri-image-dicom/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=lumbar-spine)**

The dataset supports segmentation algorithms and classification models, aiming for accurate automatic segmentations and classification results. Deep learning techniques can be applied to medical images to assess spinal stenosis, detect degenerative changes, and segment spinal structures. The spinal pathology covered includes conditions like spinal cord compression, canal stenosis, and other lumbar spinal disorders. The dataset also includes sagittal views and axial views, making it suitable for machine learning and medical diagnosis tasks.
